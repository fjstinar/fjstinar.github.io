      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a <a href="https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/frank-stinar">5th year PhD student in the School of Information Sciences</a> at the University of Illinois Urbana--Champaign. I teach courses on web design and development, programming and computational thinking, and on telling stories with data.</p>
      <p>My research interests focus on understanding the experiences people have during life transitions and how those experiences are represented in sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in how people make decisions about the data that are left behind in the wake of a romantic relationship ending, and how those decisions contribute to the formation of post-break-up identities.</p>
      <p>I am concurrently <a href="https://ist.psu.edu/directory/atp136">an Adjunct Part-Time Faculty member</a> in Penn State's College of Information Sciences and Technology, where I have taught through Penn State's World Campus program since 2016. I am also involved in the <a href="https://www.i3-inclusion.org">iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3)</a>, most recently as a Research Advisor for a team of 2022 i3 Scholars.</p>
